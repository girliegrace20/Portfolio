                Computing refers to any goal-oriented activity that uses computers to process information, solve problems, or support daily tasks.
                Today, computing plays a major role in almost every part of human life such as education, business, communication, entertainment, and even healthcare.
                <br><br>
                The computing industry, on the other hand, focuses on the research, development, production, and use of computer technologies. 
                This includes both hardware and software that help people work more efficiently and stay connected. Fields such as Computer Science, Information Technology, and Entertainment and Multimedia Computing are all part of this industry.
                <br><br>
                This section helps learners understand what computing is, why it is important, and how it affects people and society in a positive way.

                Computer Science is a branch of science that deals with the study of computation and the design of computers. 
                It focuses on how computers solve problems and how programs are created to make machines perform specific tasks.
                <br><br>
                One important area of Computer Science is the Theory of Computation. 
                This theory explains how problems are solved using algorithms and models of computation. 
                It also studies the limits of what computers can and cannot do. Automata theory, which is part of this field, helps in the development of technologies such as artificial intelligence.

                Another key idea in Computer Science is the Three Great Insights:

                    Formal sciences focus on abstract systems such as numbers, symbols, and logical reasoning.
                    <br><br>
                    Examples of formal sciences include mathematics, logic, computer science, statistics, cryptography, information technology, and robotics. 
                    These fields rely on concepts like assigning values, determining true or false statements, and using logical rules. 
                    Mathematics and logic are among the oldest forms of science and serve as the foundation of computing.
                    <br><br>
                    With the advancement of computer technology, formal sciences have greatly benefited. 
                    Calculators help in mathematical computation, spreadsheet software supports statistical analysis through formulas and graphs, and robotics and artificial intelligence combine logic and mathematics to support research. 
                    Virtual environments also allow testing and experimenting with ideas related to logic and mathematics.

                    Natural science focuses on understanding and predicting natural phenomena through observation and experimentation. 
                    Examples of natural sciences include biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, environmental science, ecology, biochemistry, and earth science.
                    <br><br>
                    Natural sciences depend on quantifiable data obtained through research and experiments. 
                    Accuracy, validity, and peer review are important in ensuring reliable results. 
                    Fields such as biology and astronomy are some of the oldest natural sciences and continue to evolve with the help of computing.
                    <br><br>
                    The computing industry has contributed significantly to natural sciences. 
                    Electron microscopes are used in biology to examine objects not visible to ordinary microscopes. 
                    CT scans provide detailed x-ray images of internal organs. 
                    Gamma ray telescopes mounted on satellites allow scientists to observe distant celestial objects. 
                    Digital sensors also help monitor ocean movements and environmental changes.

                    Social science studies society and the relationships between people. 
                    Examples include anthropology, archaeology, education, geography, psychology, and sociology. 
                    Unlike natural sciences, social sciences use both quantitative and qualitative research, with greater emphasis on qualitative data.
                    <br><br>
                    Social sciences help explain human behavior, social structures, and historical development. 
                    Anthropology and archaeology, for example, provide insight into how science and society have evolved over time.
                    <br><br>
                    Computing has improved research and communication in social sciences. 
                    Online forms are used for polls and census activities. Educational websites support learning, while the internet connects people across different locations. 
                    Social networking platforms make it easier to observe social trends, and tools like laptops and projectors enhance teaching and presentations.

                    Before modern computers existed, people used early computing tools to perform calculations and measurements. 
                    One of the earliest tools is the <b>abacus</b>, which was used as early as the Mesopotamian period for basic arithmetic operations. 
                    It does not require electricity and is still used today, even by visually impaired users.
                    <br><br>
                    Another early tool is the <b>astrolabe</b>, developed during the Hellenistic civilization. 
                    It was used to measure the position of celestial bodies, determine latitude, and measure time.
                    <br><br>
                    The <b>Analytical Engine</b>, designed by <b>Charles Babbage</b>, is considered the first computer. 
                    It introduced key components such as memory, processor, input, and output devices. Later, the <b>ENIAC</b>, built in 1943, became the first electronic computer and was used to compute artillery range tables.
                    <br><br>
                    Many individuals contributed to modern computing, including <b>Alan Turing</b>, <b>Grace Hopper</b>, <b>Steve Jobs</b>, <b>Bill Gates</b>, and <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b>. 
                    Their innovations laid the foundation for today's computer systems.
